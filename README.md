DriverPass was a project to help better prepare their users for their driving tests via online courses and practice tests. The client sought a system to provide said help and include on-the-road-training. Their system was rather simple but can definitely be built into something more complex within an agile environment. For instance some of the requirements were as involved:
-Reservation Management
-User access control
-Data access
-Tracking and report logging
-Security
-Future Scalability

I wish I could say I did well, but due to some unfortunate circumstances it was hard for me to bounce back, but I think that my determination to try and fix some of the problems is what I did well enough...

If I could pick one part of my work in the documents I uploaded to revise, I think I would pick the business requirements. I think I overloaded on the details a bit too much and could've constrained everything to smaller bullet points and be 
more concise with the information I provided.

There were a lot of points that were constant and made apparent throughout the interview with DriverPass that made it easy to interpret what they needed and wanted in the program. It's important to consider the user's needs when designing because it would ensure the final product aligns with the objectives and goals of the client creating a better experience for development and collaboration. 

I approach designing software from a head-on approach of what I think I want but struggle to actually put it all together. Sort of a brute force kind of way until I get what I want. However, I think with what I learned making the different diagrams and reading the materials, I think I'm going to be using more of my time planning my needs and objectives for the program. I think having a clear plan of action rather than just straight up coding would be a lot more resourceful in the end and make my time coding and processing information a lot faster.
